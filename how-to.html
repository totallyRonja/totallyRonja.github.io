    <ul>
      <li>
        I have ADHD and Autism
        <ul>
          <li>I tend to forget things like names or who I told what to, so I tend to ask things again or tell things twice or sometimes assume people know things I havent told them yet. 
            Best to tell me when something is confusing and I can update what know and act accordingly.</li>
          <li>I often struggle with starting tasks, no matter whether I want to do them or not. Body doubling and ADHD meds help. (I only manage to take my meds less than half of the time)</li>
          <li>
            I mask a lot and learning how to do it less is a slow process.
            <ul>
              <li>
                One shape this takes is that I tend to prioritize looking cool and impressive over expressing what I actually want to express.
                <ul>
                  <li>Friends often tell me that I dont have to try so hard and that relaxing about how I'm being percieved does not make me less likable (or makes me more likable), but allowing myself that is a process...</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Another way this shows up in is that I tend to not be in touch with my feelings.
                <ul>
                  <li>Sitting down with someone I trust and taking about my feelings and them asking questions can help me explore feelings.</li>
                  <li>Sometimes this leads to me only realizing I'm overwhelmed because I notice myself crying. Or realizing it after the fact when I've been running on autopilot for hours.</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm really into fashion right now? Matching daily outfits, historical fashion, sewing my own fashion...
