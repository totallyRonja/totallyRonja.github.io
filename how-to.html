    <h1>
      Ronjanomicon
    </h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I have ADHD and Autism
        <ul>
          <li>
            I tend to forget things like names or who I told what to, so I tend to ask things again or tell things twice or sometimes assume people know things I havent told them yet. 
            Best to tell me when something is confusing and I can update what know and act accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>Sometimes I write sentences out of order and they end up very nonsensical. I usually edit the messages when I notice. (and in general I like to edit messages in messengers to change phrasing or add details)</li>
          <li>I often struggle with starting tasks, no matter whether I want to do them or not. Body doubling and ADHD meds help. (I only manage to take my meds less than half of the time)</li>
          <li>
            I mask a lot and learning how to do it less is a slow process.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mostly this shows itself in acting based on what I think how others would like me to act over acting on my own decisions. Sometimes I'm not sure whats "me" and what my persona I crafted.
              </li>
              <li>
                Often I feel like the way I mask makes me seem more competent/confident/funny and I prioritize seeming like that over genuine expression.
              </li>
              <li>
                My masking also comes from a fear of hurting people if I dont overly control how I interact with them. Also a fear of being "too much" and that pushing people away.
              </li>
              <li>
                Also sometimes all communication feels hard and like masking, so finding a way to communicate that still feels authentic is often really hard.
              </li>
              <li>
                Especially when I'm overwhelmed I forget to listen to my own motivations and just fall into a kind of autopilot.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sometimes I also mask over negative feelings. 
                Partially because I dont want to "burden" others with my feelings. 
                Partially because the mask allows me to go out and be social in ways that help and which would have not been possible to me without masking.
                This has less been the case lately, now that my depression has been better.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            I tend to not be in touch with my feelings.
            <ul>
              <li>Sometimes this leads to me only realizing I'm overwhelmed because I notice myself crying. Or realizing it after the fact when I've been running on autopilot for hours.</li>
              <li>Sitting down with someone I trust and taking about my feelings and them asking questions can help me explore feelings.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Sometimes I express feelings by chirping or similar weird sounds.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I appreciate radical honesty and like being made uncomfortable.
        <ul>
          <li>I prefer being made uncomfortable in a context where it feels low stakes and I am free to disagree with your opinions about me.</li>
          <li>I prefer it (or any other form of emotional vulnerability) to happen in person where its easy and quick to check in general interpersonal feelings.</li>
          <li>When done well this can be a shortcut to getting to me trusting you more. 
            (it isnt the only way of making me trust you and getting me to unmask around you more)</li>
          <li>I think being made uncomfortable sometimes makes me trust you more that you communicate if I do something that makes you uncomfortable or hurts you otherwise and I dont constantly need to be on the lookout for avoiding that?</li>
          <li>Being confronted with things also often helps me feel feelings I have that I struggle to feel otherwise.</li>
          <li>Also I like being a contrarian little shit and getting resistance/feedback in a safe setting feels good.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I like touch.
        <ul>
          <li>I dont *always* like touch from *everyone*, so its still important to check in.</li>
          <li>When I'm overwhelmed touch by people I trust often helps, but I may need a moment to adjust before.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I really like crafting.
        <ul>
          <li>I really like showing off my projects, so always feel free to ask me about them!</li>
          <li>sometimes projects lay dormant for weeks to years and I'm fine with that. (see > ADHD)</li>
          <li>I do woodworking/leatherworking/sewing/soldering(for aesthetics and electronics)/3d printing/silicone casting/maybe I'm forgetting something or already picked up something new...</li>
          <li>I also like having tools, but thats only partially related.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>My job is making video games/making tools for making video games.
        <ul>
          <li>It used to be more of a primary interrest/hobby too, but I still enjoy doing it and am happy to talk about it.</li>
          <li>If youre curious, the last game I worked on was Saltsea Chronicles and I think its really good!</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I'm really into fashion right now and am happ to talk about it?! Matching daily outfits, historical fashion, sewing my own fashion...
      </li>
      <li>I practice relationship anarchy.
        <ul>
          <li>I have multiple relationships that I dont clearly label as romantic or platonic and whether I consider someone a "partmer" is often not very fixed.</li>
          <li>I dont do well with implicit hopes or expectations based on unrelated experiences or labels, so try to communicate them openly and I try to do the same.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>I'm very queer.
        <ul>
          <li>I'm happy to chat about queer experiences and politics.</li>
          <li>I first came out to family, school etc in 2014.</li>
          <li>While I often say I'm "approximately female", I dont fully identify with the woman label and don't like being called a binary woman.</li>
          <li>I had vaginoplasty in 08/2023 and I'm happy to chat about my thoughts and experiences around it (I feel like I didnt really have ppl around me to talk about that before so I'm happy to be that for others).</li>
          <li>I dont think I've been attracted to a cis guy yet, but I think extrapolating that to a rule to limit myself in the future is silly.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
