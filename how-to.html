    <ul>
      <li>
        I have ADHD and Autism
        <ul>
          <li>
            I tend to forget things like names or who I told what to, so I tend to ask things again or tell things twice or sometimes assume people know things I havent told them yet. 
            Best to tell me when something is confusing and I can update what know and act accordingly.
          </li>
          <li>I often struggle with starting tasks, no matter whether I want to do them or not. Body doubling and ADHD meds help. (I only manage to take my meds less than half of the time)</li>
          <li>
            I mask a lot and learning how to do it less is a slow process.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Mostly this shows itself in acting based on what I think how others would like me to act over acting on my own decisions. Sometimes I'm not sure whats "me" and what my persona I crafted.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sometimes I also mask over negative feelings. 
                Partially because I dont want to "burden" others with my feelings. 
                Partially because the mask allows me to go out and be social in ways that help and which would have not been possible to me without masking.
                This has less been the case lately that my depression has been better.
              </li>
              <li>
                Especially when I'm overwhelmed I forget to listen to my own motivations and just fall into a kind of autopilot.
              </li>
              <li>
                Often I feel like the way I mask makes me seem more competent/confident/funny and I prioritize seeming like that over genuine expression.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            I tend to not be in touch with my feelings.
            <ul>
              <li>Sometimes this leads to me only realizing I'm overwhelmed because I notice myself crying. Or realizing it after the fact when I've been running on autopilot for hours.</li>
              <li>Sitting down with someone I trust and taking about my feelings and them asking questions can help me explore feelings.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Sometimes I express feelings by chirping or simiar weird sounds.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        I love crafting
        <ul>
          <li>I do woodworking/leatherworking/sewing/soldering(for aesthetics and electronics)/3d printing/silicone casting/maybe I'm forgetting something or already picked up something new...</li>
          <li>I also like having tools, but thats only partially related.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm really into fashion right now and am happ to talk about it?! Matching daily outfits, historical fashion, sewing my own fashion...
      </li>
      <li>
        I practice relationship anarchy.
        <ul>
          <li>I have multiple relationships that I dont clearly label as romantic or platonic and if I consider someone a "partmer" is often not very fixed.</li>
          <li>I dont do well with implicit hopes or expectations based on unrelated experiences or labels, so try to communicate them openly and I try to do the same.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        I'm very queer.
        <ul>
          <li>I'm happy to chat about queer experiences and politics.</li>
          <li>I first came to family, school etc in 2014.</li>
          <li>While I often say I'm "approximately female", I dont fully identify with the woman label and don't like being called a binary woman.</li>
          <li>I had vaginoplasty in 08/2023 and I'm happy to chat about my thoughts and experiences around it.</li>
          <li>I dont think I've been attracted to a cis guy yet, but I think extrapolating that to a rule to limit myself in the future is silly.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
